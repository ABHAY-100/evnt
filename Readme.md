# evnt.

## Overview

**evnt.** is an innovative event management automation tool specifically designed for college clubs and organizations. By streamlining the processes involved in organizing workshops, seminars, and meetups, **evnt.** aims to alleviate the administrative burden often faced by event organizers. Our solution allows teams to focus on delivering outstanding experiences rather than getting bogged down by manual tasks.

## Problem Statement

As college students, we often found ourselves overwhelmed by the challenges of manually managing participant groups during events. For instance, while organizing an event like ABC, we needed to create a community and efficiently manage various groups for participants, volunteers, and different teams (such as marketing and logistics). The process of manually adding members based on Google Form responses was not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. Recognizing this need for automation, we developed **evnt.** to simplify and optimize event management.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Group Management**: Effortlessly create WhatsApp Communities and automatically assign participants and organizers to relevant WhatsApp Groups tailored to specific event requirements.

2. **Seamless Registration Process**: Generate Google Forms for event registration, ensuring efficient data collection and management.

3. **Streamlined Participant Addition**: Automatically extract participant information from Google Forms responses and add them to designated WhatsApp groups, reducing manual entry errors and ensuring a smooth onboarding process.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface that allows users to navigate the application with ease, making event management straightforward and efficient.

## Challenges Faced

During our intensive 15-hour hackathon, we successfully developed the front end of **evnt.** but encountered several challenges, including:

- **WhatsApp API Limitations**: Gaining access to the WhatsApp API proved to be complex, with potential risks of account bans when using unauthorized methods.
- **Transition to Alternative Platforms**: We explored using Telegram and Discord for group management, but faced limitations regarding group or server creation capabilities.
