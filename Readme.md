## Overview

**evnt.** is a powerful event management automation tool designed to streamline the organization of events across various sectors. By automating tasks like participant registration and group management, **evnt.** allows organizers to focus on delivering memorable experiences rather than getting bogged down by administrative work.

<br />

## Problem Statement

Organizing events often requires manually managing participant information and group communications, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. For example, during a Tech Conference, organizers must create separate groups for speakers, volunteers, and attendees, complicating communication and coordination.

evnt. simplifies this process by automating group creation and participant management, allowing organizers to focus on delivering a successful event.

<br />

## Key Features

1. **Automated Group Management**: Effortlessly create WhatsApp Communities and automatically assign participants and organizers to relevant WhatsApp Groups tailored to specific event requirements.

2. **Seamless Registration Process**: Generate Google Forms for event registration, ensuring efficient data collection and management.

3. **Streamlined Participant Addition**: Automatically extract participant information from Google Forms responses and add them to designated WhatsApp groups, reducing manual entry errors and ensuring a smooth onboarding process.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive interface that allows users to navigate the application with ease, making event management straightforward and efficient.

## Challenges Faced

During the 15-hour hackathon, we encountered two major challenges:

- **WhatsApp API Limitations**: Accessing the API was complex and risky, with unauthorized methods leading to potential bans.
- **Switch to Telegram**: By using Telegram's official API and MTProto protocol, we unlocked full user-level capabilities, overcoming the limitations of regular bots.

This transition ensured security, flexibility, and respect for user privacy.
