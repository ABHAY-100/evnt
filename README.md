## Problem Statement

Organizing events like hackathons, coding contests, and workshops often requires manual participant management, such as group creation and adding members. This process is time-consuming, especially for college-hosted or small-scale events with limited resources. A streamlined, automated solution is crucial to reduce administrative effort and enhance efficiency.

**evnt.** simplifies this process by automating group creation and participant management.

## Challenges Faced

During the 15-hour hackathon, we encountered two major challenges:

- **WhatsApp API Limitations**: Accessing the API was complex and risky, with unauthorized methods leading to potential bans.
- **Switch to Telegram**: By using Telegram's official API and MTProto protocol, we unlocked full user-level capabilities, overcoming the limitations of regular bots.

This transition ensured security, flexibility, and respect for user privacy.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up evnt. locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ABHAY-100/evnt.git
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   
    ```bash
    cd evnt
    ```
    
3. Install Dependencies
   
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set Up Environment Variables
   
   - Locate the `.env.example` file in the root of the project.
   - Create a new file named `.env` or `.env.local` in the root directory.
   - Copy and paste the contents of `.env.example` into the newly created `.env` file.

### Configure Telegram API

5. Access Telegram Developer Tools

   - Open [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org) and log in with your phone number.
   - After logging in, click on **API Development Tools**.

7. Retrieve API Credentials
   - Once created, you will be shown a page with your **API_ID** and **API_HASH**.
   - Copy these values and paste them into the `.env` file under their respective keys.

8. Add Telegram Phone Number in the `.env` file in international format as ```TELEGRAM_PHONE_NUMBER=+<YourPhoneNumber>```

9. Generate `TELEGRAM_SESSION` and Update the Environment File
    - Run the following command to generate the `TELEGRAM_SESSION` string
      
      
      
        ```bash
        npx ts-node scripts/auth-telegram.ts
        ```
    - Follow the instructions in the terminal to authenticate your Telegram account.
    - Once the `TELEGRAM_SESSION` is generated, copy the output string.
    - Open your `.env` file and add the `TELEGRAM_SESSION` key with the copied string
      
   
      
      ```bash
      TELEGRAM_SESSION=<YourGeneratedSessionString>
      ```

### Run the Application

10. Start the Application

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

11. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

### How to Use?

12. Once the application is running, open it in your browser (`http://localhost:3000`), and you will see a form.

13. Select whether you want to create a group or channel using the switch option.

14. Enter the group/channel name and description in the corresponding fields.

15. Upload a CSV file containing participant data in the following format:
    ```bash
    name, phone
    johndoe, +91933222XXXX
    janedoe, +91933852XXXX
    ```

15. If everything is configured correctly, the members will be added automatically. A success modal will appear with event statistics, and a CSV report (named `group/channelname-report.csv`) will be downloaded with a summary of the process.




<br />


## How It Works?

### Technical Implementation

The application utilizes Telegram's MTProto protocol via the `telegram` npm package, unlocking advanced capabilities beyond traditional bots. Here's a simplified breakdown:

1. Authentication & Setup
    - Authenticates using Telegram‚Äôs MTProto API with API ID, API Hash, and phone number.
    - Supports session persistence and handles two-factor authentication if enabled.

2. Group Creation
    - Accepts a CSV file of participant details and validates phone numbers.
    - Programmatically creates groups or channels, generates invite links.

3. Member Management
    - Adds members by resolving phone numbers to Telegram accounts.
    - Uses fallback methods like invite links or private messages for privacy-restricted users.

4. Operation Report
   - Produces and downloads a detailed CSV report
